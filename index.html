        <h2>General Info</h2>
        <p>
            The land of Luminaria has remained divided ever since the fall of the ancient Cymaxian Empire. The nations of Karcalia, Esteria, Surum, and Nezcal remain in a shaky peace, as military expansion is hindered by the Barbarian Clans led by dragons from the east. The world seems to lie at an unstable fixed point, where any minor change to this state could lead to more drastic consequences.

            The people of the Cymaxian Empire valued a diverse array of principles and beliefs, each associated with different gods or aspects of their religious pantheon:<br/><br/>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Valor:</span> Associated with Pelor, also known as El in some derivations.</li>
                <li><span>Justice:</span> Revered under the deity Invictus, who was the sole god for this concept.</li>
                <li><span>Bounty and Life:</span> Worshipped through Vona, particularly by the regions of Karcalia and Esteria.</li>
                <li><span>Chaos and The Tempest:</span> Rhea was the deity associated with these turbulent forces.</li>
                <li><span>Nature and Death:</span> Atropos was revered for her dominion over these aspects of existence.</li>
                <li><span>Trickery and Luck:</span> Tacitus was the god associated with deception and good fortune.</li>
                <li><span>Arcana and Knowledge:</span> Kalestis was worshipped for her vast understanding and connection to arcane mysteries.</li>
                <li><span>Forge, Production, and Humanity:</span> The god Bachanos presided over these aspects of craftsmanship and human endeavor.</li>
                <li><span>Chaos and War:</span> Hyperion was the deity representing chaos and the art of war.</li>
            </ul>
            Each of these values and deities played a significant role in shaping the culture, beliefs, and practices of the people within the Cymaxian Empire.

        <h2>Elsir Vale</h2>
        <img src="https://connorssettings.wdfiles.com/local--files/elsir-vale/elsir_vale_map__player__by_antariuk-d8cyaxy.jpg" height="400">
        <p>
            The Elsir Vale is a thinly populated frontier, stretching from east to west for almost 250 miles (402 kms.), and averaging about 70 miles (112 kms.) from north to south. Several small mountain ranges and dense forests form the Vale's boundaries. Though the borders of the vale are mostly hills, mountains and forests, the heart of the vale is grassy plains for the most part. Every town in the vale is surrounded by numerous farms. Beyond the civilized areas are vast rolling plains with infrequent hillocks and copses of trees.


            Summers in the vale are hot and dry (although punctuated by the occasional intense thunderstorm), and winters are warm and rainy. Large stretches of the area are quite arid, and the vale is flanked by the vast savannahs stretching for miles. The forests that stretch across most of the vale's northern reaches are stifling and sweltering hot in the summertime, with not a breath of wind to relieve the oppressive heat.


            <h3>History
            </h3>
            Several civilizations have come and gone over the last thousand years in the vale. An ancient dwarf-kingdom that spanned the Wyrmsmoke, Giantshield, and Stonehome Mountains more than a thousand years ago built most of the roadways, the city of Overlook and the fortresses in the pass]After the dwarf-realm passed, the presence of various monsters and raiders kept traffic along the Dawn Way light for many years; few caravans dared the long and dangerous trek. Few humans lived in Elsir Vale during those years—only scattered settlements of druidic folk who left behind little more than grassy barrows and stone circles on the hilltops


            About five hundred years ago, the nearby city of Rhest came to control the vale. Soldiers from Rhest secured the roads all the way to The Grand Bazaar and beyond, creating a safe passage for trade. Under the kingdom's shield, the towns along the Dawn Way—Brindol, Talar, Terrelton, and the rest—grew up from tiny hamlets or lonely soldiers' posts to flourishing human settlements. As the Dawn Way became an important route for trade, the kingdom of Blackthorn grew wealthy on the tariffs exacted from the passing merchants. Eventually, Blackthorn became a very strong empire, nearly rivaling the Great Three.

            Rhest eventually collapsed under civil strife, monstrous incursions, and magical blights. Almost two hundred years ago, the city of Rhest was burned by a savage Horde of Balzerion. Although the warriors of Blackthorn killed many of the barbarians and their kind, the city was abandoned and the already weakened kingdom broken. A few years later, the whole Empire of Blackthorn collapsed as well. Since then, the towns of Elsir Vale came to look after themselves. While most of the local lords still hold titles derived from the old kingdom of Blackthorn and everyone knows that the kings of Blackthorn were long dead, no new realm has arisen in the Vale.
